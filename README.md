# Kill-Counter
A little AutoHotkey + Python (3) script for displaying a kill counter (odometer style) in OBS, or possibly other applications.

# What it does:
When you activate the hotkeys (Indicated in the .AHK file), it will either incriment, decriment, or reset (only the match kills) for the included data files.

# How to use:
I configured OBS to load the datafile as a text element on screen, which allows you to have a dynamic text element on stream.

# Sofrtware requirements:
Latest version of autohotkey! Latest version of Python (3) [Make sure you have pythonw.exe associated with .pyw files!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1689015/run-python-script-without-windows-console-appearing), Put all of the files in a folder and it'll "just werkâ„¢", NOTE: you can have seperate folders for seperate games, other counters.
